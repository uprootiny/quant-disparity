# Decision Log

## D001: Pivot from Fertility to Kurtosis

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Decision:** Abandon tokenization fertility hypothesis, adopt weight distribution hypothesis.
**Evidence:** Real tokenizer fertility r=0.34 (not significant), mock kurtosis r=0.92 (significant).
**Rationale:** Vocabulary coverage confounds fertility measurement across tokenizers.

## D002: Use BLOOM-560M for Validation

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Decision:** Use BLOOM-560M for Phase 1 weight extraction.
**Alternatives:** Aya-8B (too large), XGLM-564M (less multilingual coverage).
**Rationale:** Small enough for CPU, good multilingual coverage.

## D003: Target Soudry Lab

**Date:** 2026-01-01
**Decision:** Frame proposal for Soudry Lab (Technion).
**Rationale:** Methodology alignment with Banner and Chmiel papers.
**Alternative:** Belinkov Lab (probing focus, different angle).

## D004: Go/No-Go Thresholds

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Decision:** Use r > 0.7 as GO threshold, r < 0.3 as PIVOT threshold.
**Rationale:** Conservative given small sample size (14 languages).

## D005: Phased Compute Approach

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Decision:** Validate on CPU before investing in GPU compute.
**Rationale:** Minimize cost until hypothesis validated.

## D006: Hypothesis Refinement

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Finding:** Real weight analysis shows BLOOM-560M has globally heavy-tailed weights.
**Mean kurtosis:** +30 (vs mock assumption of 0.3-2.4)
**Extreme layers:** 5, 21, 22 have kurtosis >100
**Decision:** Shift from "per-language weight kurtosis" to "per-layer kurtosis × per-language activation"
**Next step:** Analyze which layers activate most for each language.

## D007: Surprising Negative Correlation

**Date:** 2026-01-02
**Finding:** r = -0.77 (p = 0.001) between activation-weighted kurtosis and degradation.
**Interpretation:** Languages with LOWER weighted kurtosis (relying more on early layers) degrade MORE.
**Hypothesis revision:** Early layer fragility for under-represented languages.
**Evidence:**
- eng/fra (w.kurt=43) → low degradation (0.005-0.007)
- ara/hin (w.kurt=38) → high degradation (0.021-0.025)
**Next step:** Validate on another model (XGLM) or investigate early/late layer sensitivity directly.
